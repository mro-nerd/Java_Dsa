/*
Problem:
---------
We are given n sorted points on a line (array a[0..n-1]).
We want to count the number of triplets (i, j, k) with i < j < k < n
such that:

    a[k] - a[i] <= d   (the max distance in the triplet is at most d)

Key Observations:
-----------------
1. The array a[] is sorted.
   â†’ So if a[r] - a[l] <= d, then ALL points between l and r
     also satisfy the condition with l as the left boundary.

2. For each fixed left index l:
   - Find the maximum index r such that a[r] - a[l] <= d.
   - Then, any two indices j, k with l < j < k <= r
     will form a valid triplet (i = l, j, k).
   - Count how many such pairs (j, k) exist.

3. Number of valid pairs (j, k) = Choose 2 out of (r - l) elements.
   Formula: C(r-l, 2) = (r-l) * (r-l-1) / 2

4. Use a sliding window / two pointers:
   - Increase r while condition holds.
   - Move l forward one by one.
   - r never moves backwards (O(n) total complexity).
