/*SmallR is an archer. SmallR is taking a match of archer with Zanoes. They try to shoot in the target in turns, and SmallR shoots first. The probability of shooting the target each time is a/b for SmallR while c/d for Zanoes. The one who shoots in the target first should be the winner.

Output the probability that SmallR will win the match.

Input
A single line contains four integers 1<=a,b,c,d<=1000.

Output
Print a single real number, the probability that SmallR will win the match.

The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10^-6. */
